                    <p>For assessing user requirements, an SRS (Software Requirement Specification) document is created
                        whereas for coding and implementation, there is a need of more specific and detailed
                        requirements in software terms. The output of this process can directly be used into
                        implementation in programming languages.

                        level, the designers get the idea of proposed solution domain.
