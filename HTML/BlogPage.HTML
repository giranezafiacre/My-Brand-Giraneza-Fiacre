                    <p>refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like
                        humans
                        and
                        mimic their actions.The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated
                        with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.</p>

                    <p>The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take
                        actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal.</p><br>

                        in software coding and implementation.</p>

                    <p>For assessing user requirements, an SRS (Software Requirement Specification) document is created
                        whereas for coding and implementation, there is a need of more specific and detailed
                        requirements in software terms. The output of this process can directly be used into
                        implementation in programming languages.

                    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the
                        meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to
                        describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
                    </p>

                    <p>"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites.
