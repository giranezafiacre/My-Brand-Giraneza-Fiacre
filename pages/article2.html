                        in software coding and implementation.</p>

                    <p>For assessing user requirements, an SRS (Software Requirement Specification) document is created
                        whereas for coding and implementation, there is a need of more specific and detailed
                        requirements in software terms. The output of this process can directly be used into
                        implementation in programming languages.

                        It identifies the software as a system with many components interacting with each other. At this
                        level, the designers get the idea of proposed solution domain.
