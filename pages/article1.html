                        and
                        mimic their actions.The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated
                        with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.</p>

                    <p>The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take
                        actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal.</p><br>

                <h3>Understanding Artificial Intelligence</h3>
                <p>When most people hear the term artificial intelligence, the first thing they usually think of is
                    robots.
                    That's because big-budget films and novels weave stories about human-like machines that wreak havoc
                    on
                    Earth. But nothing could be further from the truth.</p>

                <p>Artificial intelligence is based on the principle that human intelligence can be defined in a way
                    that a
                    machine can easily mimic it and execute tasks, from the most simple to those that are even more
                    complex.
                    The goals of artificial intelligence include learning, reasoning, and perception.</p>

                <p>As technology advances, previous benchmarks that defined artificial intelligence become outdated. For
                    example, machines that calculate basic functions or recognize text through optimal character
                    recognition
                    are no longer considered to embody artificial intelligence, since this function is now taken for
                    granted
                    as an inherent computer function.</p>
                <div class="last">
                    <p>AI is continuously evolving to benefit many different industries. Machines are wired using a
                        cross-disciplinary approach based in mathematics, computer science, linguistics, psychology, and
                        more.
